# Museum_Website_Project
## This is the 2nd year (Semester 1 of 2018) project in Web programming course.
In this project, the instructor asked us to gather the infomation about applilances of each tribe in Thailand from the museum. 
After we got the information, we had to develop a responsive website.

And this is that website >> [Click here for Demo of Museum_Website_Project](https://benzdechapon.github.io/Museum_Website_Project/)
